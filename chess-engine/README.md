Chess-Engine
============
A collection of simple chess engines.


It is a derivative of MSCP, but rewritten for beginners trying to learn chess programmming.

Engine.c has some very bad evaluation function as of now, but will be updating it soon.

Engine_2.c has much better play than Engine.c

Engine_3.c is a mild improvement over Engine_2.c

Apart From these, the original chess engine (MSCP.c) (bit advanced) is also included.
